# Video Assets

This directory is for storing video files and thumbnails used in the VideoTickerComponent.

You'll need to add the following files to match the references in the videoData.ts file:

1. fitness-thumbnail.jpg
2. balatro-thumbnail.jpg
3. arcade-thumbnail.jpg
4. music-thumbnail.jpg
5. cooldown-thumbnail.jpg

And the corresponding video files:
1. fitness-sample.mp4
2. balatro-sample.mp4
3. arcade-sample.mp4
4. music-sample.mp4
5. cooldown-sample.mp4

The images in the shared reference depict:
- Apple Fitness+ workout scenes
- Balatro+ card game visuals
- Apple Arcade game content
- Apple Music A-List Pop playlist
- Mindful cooldowns for athletes

For testing, you can use placeholder images and videos until you have the actual content.
